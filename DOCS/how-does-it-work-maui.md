## How does WebAuthenticator work in MAUI?

1. **Initiating the Login Process**: Your .NET MAUI app initiates the login process by using the default browser of the operating system to open the login URL. This URL contains information such as a unique identifier for the login request and instructions on how the login process should proceed.

2. **Successful Login and Redirect URL**: After the user logs in successfully, the authentication server opens a redirect URL, for example, `authtest://logincallback`. This URL uses a custom protocol (in this case, `authtest://`) which isn't a real protocol but a custom scheme registered by your app on each platform. The URL also includes query parameters to pass additional information such as an access token or authorization code.

3. **Handling the Redirect URL in the App**: When this URL is opened, the operating system checks if there's an app registered to handle the `authtest://` scheme. If there is, your app is launched (or brought to the foreground if it's already running) and the redirect URL is passed to it. Your app must validate the redirect URL and process the information passed in it. If the running instance can handle the redirect URL, the login result is processed, and if the app was newly launched, the new instance is closed.

4. **Processing the Login Result**: After the redirect URL is processed, the 'await' call finishes and your app should get a `LoginResult` object that indicates whether the login was successful and contains other information, such as an access token.

5. **Setting Authorization Header**: If the login was successful, you can use the access token to set the `Authorization` header on your `HttpClient` object. This is usually done by setting the header value to `Bearer {access_token}`.

6. **Accessing Authorized Endpoints**: With the `Authorization` header set, your `HttpClient` is now able to make requests to API endpoints that require authorization. The server will use the `Authorization` header to validate the request and provide the requested data if the access token is valid.

Remember to handle potential errors and edge cases, such as the user cancelling the login process or the access token being expired or revoked. If you do not do this, your app may crash!
